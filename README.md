HoloAgent is a unified embodied-agent framework for general-purpose robots, integrating closed-loop execution, 3D spatial memory, and robot skills for real-world tasks.

## 🔥 News
- **[2026.12 (expected)]** HoloAgent-1 is expected by the end of the year.
- **[2026.06]** HoloAgent-0 is released. Code is under preparation and will be released soon.
- **[2025.09]** FSR-VLN is released for fast-and-slow vision-language navigation.

<!-- ## 🚀 HoloAgent-0
> ***HoloAgent-0*** connects Embodied AgentOS, 3D spatial memory, and embodied skills for real-world robot deployment.

It targets long-horizon navigation, object search, cross-robot coordination, mobile manipulation, and runtime-feedback-driven recovery. Code will be released in this repository after it is ready. -->

## 🧩 Components
- **Embodied AgentOS:** Coordinates high-level task planning, runtime feedback, and closed-loop robot execution.
- **3D Spatial Memory:** Grounds robot reasoning in physical-world spatial representations for long-horizon tasks.
- **Embodied Skills:** Connects agent decisions to executable robot navigation and manipulation skills.
- **FSR-VLN:** Provides fast-and-slow vision-language navigation with a hierarchical multi-modal scene graph.

## 🧠 Framework for Closed-Loop Robot Execution

AgentOS turns language instructions into monitored skill graphs and closes the loop across spatial retrieval, execution, memory updates, and recovery.
